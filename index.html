                        Hi, I'm Matt, a Full Stack Developer. I've always wanted to be a programmer, and finally took
                        the
                        plunge to formalize my education in the fall of 2019. I studied at the University of Arizona's
                        Extension Coding Boot Camp (Go Wildcats!) and graduated early summer of 2020. With the amazing
                        curriculum at UofA, I was able to master CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScipt for the front end. For the
                        backend I use MYSQL and MongoDB. I also learned JQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars and React.js.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since graduating with my UofA certificate, I've been continuing my education by learning Java,
                        Python and Php.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My family is my biggest motivator. Not only did they support me during my education, but they
                        are my
                        biggest fans in all that I do involving programming. Take a look at my portfolio, which has been
                        thoroughly approved by my 2 year old as "cool" and I hope you feel the same.
